# MatchVNE
Execution Environment:
Operation System: Microsoft Windows 10, 64bit.
Physical Memory (RAM) 16.0 GB.
Python 3.9.
PyCharm Community Edition 2021.2.
Alib utility for VNE simulation.

Step 1: Download ALIB_Utility tool unzip(alib utility in par with python 2.7) and copy to the execution drive. 1a. Configure the alib by following the steps mentioned in the link(https://github.com/vnep-approx/alib). 1b. Generate the input.pickle file and save it it the P3_ALIB_MASTER\input path. 1b. Make sure "P3_ALIB_MASTER\input" path contain senario_RedBestel.pickle. If not, generate the substrate network senario for senario_RedBestel in folder P3_ALIB_MASTER\input and this pickle file contain substrate network information.

Step 2: Download MatchVNE and keep in the drive where P3_ALIB_MASTER present. The DMatch file contain all executable files related to proposed appraoch and baselines appraoches. DAA.py -> Main file related proposed NORD appraoch.
greedy.py -> Main file related VNE-MWF baselines.


Step 3: In vne_u.py, we can set the various parameters related to Virtula network requests(VNRs).

3a. We can set the minimum and maximum number of VMs of a VNRs in create_vne function.

3b. We can set the virtual network requests demands like BandWidth(min,max), CRB(min,max), LocationX(min,max), LocationY(min,max), Delay(min,max) in vne.append function. 
EX: (1, 5, 1, 10, 0, 100, 0, 100, 1, 4) 

3c. Run vne_u.py after doing any modification.
Step 4: In grpah_extraction_uniform.py:

4a. In sude the get_graphs function mention the pickle file related to substrate network generation, same is available in the folder P3_ALIB_MASTER.
EX:
 os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(current),
        "P3_ALIB_MASTER",
        "input",
        "senario_RedBestel.pickle",)

4b. In graph.parameters function  set substrate network resources like BandWidth(min,max), CRB(min,max), LocationX(min,max), LocationY(min,max), Delay(min,max). 
	Ex: (500, 1000, 200, 1000, 0, 100, 0, 100, 1, 1)

4c. Run grpah_extraction_uniform.py after doing any modification.
Step 5: In automate.py file set the VNRs size such as [250, 500, 750, 1000] and also mnetion the number iteration need to execute for each VNRs size in the iteration variable.

Step 6: Finally run the automate.py file. After succesful running a 1_uniform.pickle file is created and it is having all input parameters realted to both substrate network and Virtual network request parameeters and final embedding results are captured in the Results.xlsx.
